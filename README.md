## Project Description

This app allows users to select their top 3 hotels from a provided list. The list is displayed as slides, which can be navigated using the "Siguiente" and "Anterior" buttons. The app is built with React using Vite.

The hotel list is stored in an array in a separate file (`data.jsx`) and displayed using the `.map()` method. When a hotel is selected for the top 3, a new array is created to store the selected hotels. The app enforces certain restrictions: users cannot select more than three hotels, and the same hotel cannot be selected twice. If these conditions are violated, an alert message appears. Selected hotels can be removed from the top 3 using the "Remove" button, utilizing the `.filter()` method.

No installation is required.
